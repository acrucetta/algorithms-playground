# Concurrency Principles:

- **Concurrency**: The ability to run multiple programs or parts of a program in parallel.
- **Parallelism**: The ability to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Asynchronous**: The ability to execute tasks without waiting for the previous task to complete.

# Concurrency Models:

- **Thread-based Concurrency**: Threads are the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. Threads are used to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Event-based Concurrency**: Events are used to execute tasks without waiting for the previous task to complete.
- **Actor-based Concurrency**: Actors are used to execute multiple programs or parts of a program in parallel.

# Concurrency Patterns:

- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: The producer-consumer pattern is used to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Master-Worker Pattern**: The master-worker pattern is used to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Pipeline Pattern**: The pipeline pattern is used to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Fork-Join Pattern**: The fork-join pattern is used to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
