### Example Questions

- Given a hash table of objects, iterating takes a constant amount of time, except when it takes much longer? When would that happen?

- You're working on a video editor and need to show events (identified by start and end timestamps) in swimlane tracks. A single track cannot contain events that overlap. Implement an algorithm that receives an array of events and outputs list of tracks (arrays) containing the list of events that should be shown on that track. [x]

- Design a system that is able to process N types of jobs - i.e. job of types A, B, C, etc. The pipelines of jobs per type should be independent, i.e. a long-running job A should block only the queue of jobs A, but not block the queue of jobs B. And the results from each type of job queues should be delivered in the order of input.

- Walk through a directory-like structure, outputting the names of folders and files. Each folder/file should be indented to the left according to its level from the root, and also should have the number of files it contains overall beneath it.

- How ConcurrentHashMaps are implemented?

- The first guy wanted me to implement a ReadWrite lock. Which I did. I love concurrency design patterns. I wanted to engage more and talk about RCU locks or fairness in lock acquisition or cool ways of avoiding deadlocks in code

- What's a thread vs a process?
